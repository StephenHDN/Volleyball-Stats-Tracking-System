# Volleyball-Stats-Tracking-System 🏐
This is a Volleyball team tracking database system tracks information of a volleyball team’s members. You can add members of the team by giving all the required information of a member and to delete, you provide an ID. All team members will have an ID, first name, last name, age, and role. The team members that you can track are players and coaches. The database will also show a player’s jersey number, yearly salary, and the number of each type of points scored and a coach’s number of hours worked, hourly wage and the number of games won and lost. The database will take inputs from .csv files that contain the members of the volleyball team’s information and you will then be able to modify things such as scored points of a player or career total games won/lost for coaches. After modifying, you can save it to another .csv file with the new information. You will also be able to search for specific team members and team members with a certain role, sort by age and alphabetically, and calculate the percentage of 3 pointers, 2 point baskets and free throws for players and the win-loss percentage for coaches.
