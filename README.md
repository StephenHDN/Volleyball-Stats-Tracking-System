# Volleyball-Stats-Tracking-System
Leveraging Object-Oriented Programming concepts such as Inheritance, Encapsulation, Abstraction, and Polymorphism in Java, we've engineered a sophisticated database system designed to meticulously track and manage the statistics and profiles of both volleyball and basketball team members. This comprehensive system offers seamless integration with CSV file imports, allowing for the easy addition and deletion of team members, including players and coaches. Each team member is uniquely identified and their profiles detailed with specific information such as age, role, and, for players, statistics like jersey number, yearly salary, and scored points. Coaches' profiles detail hours worked, hourly wage, and game performance.

Our system empowers users to not only search and sort team members by various criteria but also to modify critical statistics such as scored points for players or career total games won and lost for coaches. With functionalities to calculate percentages for players' 3 pointers, 2 point baskets, free throws, and coaches' win-loss ratios, the database provides a user-friendly experience that enhances data handling efficiency. Modifications are easily saved back into a CSV file, ensuring up-to-date information is maintained. This advanced database system embodies a holistic approach to team member management, offering unparalleled support for tracking and analyzing volleyball and basketball teams' dynamics.
























This basketball team tracking database system tracks information of a basketball team’s members. You can add members of the team by giving all the required information of a member and to delete, you provide an ID. All team members will have an ID, first name, last name, age, and role. The team members that you can track are players and coaches. The database will also show a player’s jersey number, yearly salary, and the number of each type of points scored and a coach’s number of hours worked, hourly wage and the number of games won and lost. The database will take inputs from .csv files that contain the members of the basketball team’s information and you will then be able to modify things such as scored points of a player or career total games won/lost for coaches. After modifying, you can save it to another .csv file with the new information. You will also be able to search for specific team members and team members with a certain role, sort by age and alphabetically, and calculate the percentage of 3 pointers, 2 point baskets and free throws for players and the win-loss percentage for coaches.
