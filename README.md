# Volleyball-Stats-Tracking-System
Leveraging Object-Oriented Programming concepts such as Inheritance, Encapsulation, Abstraction, and Polymorphism in Java, we've engineered a sophisticated database system designed to meticulously track and manage the statistics and profiles of both volleyball and basketball team members. This comprehensive system offers seamless integration with CSV file imports, allowing for the easy addition and deletion of team members, including players and coaches. Each team member is uniquely identified and their profiles detailed with specific information such as age, role, and, for players, statistics like jersey number, yearly salary, and scored points. Coaches' profiles detail hours worked, hourly wage, and game performance.

Our system empowers users to not only search and sort team members by various criteria but also to modify critical statistics such as scored points for players or career total games won and lost for coaches. With functionalities to calculate percentages for players' 3 pointers, 2 point baskets, free throws, and coaches' win-loss ratios, the database provides a user-friendly experience that enhances data handling efficiency. Modifications are easily saved back into a CSV file, ensuring up-to-date information is maintained. This advanced database system embodies a holistic approach to team member management, offering unparalleled support for tracking and analyzing volleyball and basketball teams' dynamics.
